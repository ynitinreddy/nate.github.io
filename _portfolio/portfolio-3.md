I have reimplemented multiple types of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) from scratch, following Aladdin Persson’s GAN tutorial series. This hands-on experience has given me a deep understanding of GAN architectures, training techniques, and image generation. My implementations include:

    1. Basic GAN – Fundamental adversarial training between generator and discriminator.
    2. Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) – Uses convolutional layers for stable image generation.
    3. Wasserstein GAN (WGAN & WGAN-GP) – Improves training stability with a more robust loss function.
    4. Conditional GAN (cGAN) – Enables controlled image generation using class labels.
    5. Pix2Pix & CycleGAN – Used for image-to-image translation, such as transforming sketches into photos.
    6. ESRGAN (Enhanced Super-Resolution GAN) – A state-of-the-art model for super-resolution, enhancing low-resolution images to high-definition quality.

I have experimented extensively with different loss functions, architectures, hyperparameter tuning, and training techniques to improve image quality and understand GAN convergence challenges. This project showcases my expertise in deep learning, adversarial training, and generative models.
