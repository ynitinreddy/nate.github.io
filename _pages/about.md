👨🏻‍💻 I'm a final year graduate student at the Arizona State University.

🔬 My research interests are in Graph Machine Learning and Self-Supervised Learning!

📚 I'm currently working on several independent research projects in the field of Graph-Neural-Networks and Generative Graph-Language Modelling.

# Selected Experience

## 📜 Reimplementing and Reproducing Papers
I have experience with independent research. I have implemented a novel CBAM-YOLO model to detect small instances on Aerial Images and reproduced the original results by running and tracking experiments.\
Furthermore, I also have rebuilt GPT-2 (124M) model from scratch and read the papers on GANs: Pix2Pix, CycleGAN, ProGAN, and ESRGAN and reproduced them.


## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience
Currently I am working independently as a **Student Researcher** on **Node Classification and Recommeder Systems in Graphs**.
Additionally, I have experience working on using Deep Learning on Bioinformatics.\
There I worked on classification, localization, and segmentation tasks for large medical datasets.
